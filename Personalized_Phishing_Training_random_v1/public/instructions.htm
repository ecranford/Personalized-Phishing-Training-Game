      <p> In this study we are interested in assessing how people manage their E-mails. Nowadays, people are often overwhelmed with large number of E-mail 
        communications and the management of these E-mails can become a difficult day-to-day task. 
        We're interested in assessing people's E-mail response decisions and the factors that influence their decisions.</p>
        
      <p> In this task, you will be presented with a number of prototype E-mails, both personal and work related, taken from the inbox of many potential 
      E-mail users. <b>Your goal is to examine each E-mail, with the aim of assisting in their correct classification as:</b> “Phishing” or “Ham”. 
      You will also be asked to determine your confidence in this classification. </p>
      <p>A “Phishing” E-mail is a deceptive E-mail pretending to be from a legitimate source (e.g., bank, friend) to steal money or information. 
      A “Ham” E-mail is a legitimate email. For each correct E-mail classification, you will be rewarded with 1 point. Each point you earn will 
      translate into a monetary incentive as advertised.</p>
      
      <p>The figure below shows an example of the interface that you will use in every round. During each round you will answer two questions:  <br>
      (1) Is this a phishing email? <br>
      (2) How confident are you for your answer in question 1?<br>
      You will have 30 seconds to classify and rate your confidence for each email. 
      Answer as quickly as you like, then submit your responses by clicking on the "Next" button.</p>

      <p>This study involves three phases.<b> During Phase 1 and 3, you will NOT get any feedback</b> whether you classify the E-mails correctly or incorrectly. 
      However, <b>in Phase 2, you will receive feedback </b>if you incorrectly classify a phishing email as ham. You will not recieve feedback for correct classifications 
      or for incorrectly classifying a ham email as phishing. You will receive a summary of the total points earned at the end of each phase. 
      The figure below shows an example of the kind of feedback you will receive.</p>

      <p>
      During Phase 2, you will you will be playing simultaneously with others. You will not be able to see the other players' performance, nor will they see yours. 
      However, after clicking the "Next" button to proceed to the next trial, you may have to wait for all other players to finish. 
      Please wait patiently and you will proceed promptly.
      <!--
      If you answer a phishing email incorrectly, you will receive the following feedback message
      You will receive one of the following 4 feedback messages depending on your actions: <br>
      1. This was a <b>ham </b>email and you detected it <b>correctly.</b><br>
      2. This was a <b>ham </b>email and you detected it <b>incorrectly.</b><br>
      3. This was a <b>phishing </b> email and you detected it <b>correctly.</b><br>
      4. This was a <b>phishing </b>email and you detected it <b>incorrectly.</b><br><br>
