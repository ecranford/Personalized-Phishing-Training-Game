<p>When you hear the phrase ""snake of the lake,"" what comes to mind? The Loch Ness Monster?</p>

<p>You probably wouldn't think of a congressional district. But in 2011, partisan operatives redrew Ohio's District 9 to form a barely contiguous, serpentine sliver of land that splits Democratic-leaning voters in Cleveland and Toledo into fragments &ndash; a.k.a. the ""snake of the lake.""</p>

<p>This can happen to your district, too. The practice of redrawing district lines determines the power of your vote &ndash; that's why we need to pay attention to how district lines change over time &ndash; and what that means for our political representation.</p>

<p>Here is a simple truth &mdash; no one in our country should be sitting in jail just because they are poor.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that is not the case.</p>

<p>Right now, there are over 700,000 people in county or city jails &mdash; sixty-five percent of them, more than 400,000 people, have not been convicted of a crime. Many are locked up simply because they cannot afford bail.</p>

<p>Let me be clear. The United States of America has criminalized poverty and that is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Do you want to end tuition hikes in Arizona? If you want to make college education more accessible and affordable for all, then sign our petition against Amendment 33.</p>

<p>With tuition on the rise, more and more students are turned off from college education due to its high financial investment. Amendment 33 will only increase tuition prices, further solidifying the schism between those who can afford college and those who cannot.</p>
